  <h1>Squareness</h1>
</div>

1. Use laser.dmi program to find map origi

2. Mark map origin

3. Place ball bar at map origin

4. Rotate ballbar at a 45

5. Run the Johnathan ball bar program

6. Position ball bar in the XZ, then rotate 180. Then repeat for YZ

7. Write down L1 & L2 for XZ & YZ (L1 both signs positive from center of ball bar, L2 is opposite)

8. If arc second error is more than 1.5 continue, if not no compensation is required

9.  Take L1 & L2 of axis with more than 1.5 arc sec and subtract them.
   
10. Then divide the sum by 2 and add it to the lower of the L1 & L2 to find your happy number
   
11. Open Vecpd and select 4 to view the squareness, look to see if machine has any scale factoring
   
12. Now select 4 to change squareness
   
13. Select axis and input L1 & L2
   
 14. Finally recheck to square of the axis you changed to confirm it comped it. Ideally getting your happy number. Or at least close.
