# MG Training Documentation

Welcome to the our document hub!

The flash drive is nice, but this is nicer. Feel free to either search in the search bar, or manually explore through the documentaion and videos above.
Additionally, theres some nice features about this site, like the **theme** toggle next to the **search bar**!

This is all a big work in progressk, but im constantly adding tons off stuff so be sure to check in regularly. Theres a ton to learn, which I can say confidently as going through this documentation has already tought me alot!

# More information about the site

I really wanted our site to have the ability for us all to easily edit the information on here. Unfortunately, every reasonable option kinda sucked. So atleast for now, if you see anything wrong, or anything that bugs you, LMK and I will fix it!
