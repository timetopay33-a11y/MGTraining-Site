  <h1>Straightness Setup</h1>
</div>


Required equipment varies on the space provided by the straightness run, some shots may require extra equipment because of the limited space provided by the run. 
In most cases you will use the laser, Wolstine prism & straightness reflector. If shooting Z straightness, the wolstine prism hood is required. 

Step 1: Mount the wolstine prism to the head of the probe

Step 2: Position the straightness reflector on one end of the run, with 100mm minimum spacing from the wolstine prism.

Step 3: Position the laser on the other end of the run 

Step 4: Turn on the laser and align the beam to the white dot on the wolstine prism. If shooting for Z error, rotate the prism so that the dot is at the top. If shooting for X/Y error, position the dot on the right side of the prism. ( if 45 mirror is being used then the opposite is true for shooting X & Y.)

Step 5: Run the machine down the axis while realigning the laser as needed. For distance less than half of the axis only make linear moves to the laser, for distance greater  than half the distance of the axis only move the laser in angular movements.

Step 6: Rotate the prism so that laser is shining through the glass column, ensure the column is level so that the split beams exiting the prism are also level.

Step 7: Position the straightness reflector so that the exiting beams are equally split between the center line on the reflector. 

Step 8: Move the reflector so that the beams are now shining into one half of the reflector, the beams should be on whichever side of the reflector the laser is on the prism.

Step 9: Move the reflector as needed to align the returning beam to the left dot on the laser if your reflector is vertical and the right dot if your reflector is horizontal 

Step 10: If the laser is aligned along the entire axis then the alignment is complete and you can begin capturing data (*0*)
